    "# EEB214: Understanding genetic drift through computer-based simulations in [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/)\n",
    "This tutorial (i.e. Jupyter Notebook) will guide you through some hands-on example on how *Genetic Drift* operates within populations. Read and follow the instructions below. Enter the information requested and run each block of code separately. Some blocks of code will give you an output, such as text or a plot, other will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Imagine you have a population of a species of bacteria. Individuals (i.e. cells) in the population will have either the `A` or the `a` allele at a frequency set initially by you. The you will let the population reproduce and every generation you will select randomly which individuals pass on their genes. Now, all population genetic models have a set of (normally simplifying) assumptions. In our case, we will assume that the population size (total number of individuals at any given generation) will remain constant. That means that the initial number of individuals (population size) will be the same every generation. Also, remember that bacteria are [haploid](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy) (only one set of chromosomes) as opposed to humans being [diploid](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy) (two sets of chromosomes), meaning that every individual will only have one  of the alleles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the simulation works is that every generation we'll randomly sample alleles. We'll keep on doing that until one allele get's \"fixed\" or goes \"extinct\" in the population. For tractability, we will only focus on the fate of allele `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "* Run through the exersizes\n",
    "* Try to understand what's happening in each step\n",
    "* Use your results (text and plots) to answer the quiz on [Quercus](https://q.utoronto.ca/). How does changing the initial parameters of the simulation help you understand how *Genetic Drift* operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's get started\n",
